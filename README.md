# MS3_Vending_Machine

## Vending Machine Software
We are building new Java based software that will run on a vending machine. The application
will receive a JSON file at any given time and will update the functionality of the machine. When
a consumer enters a selection, it should report what was selected.
### Requirements:

- Provide a loading option for new product lists to update.
- Rows will be Letters.
- Columns will be Numbers.
- User must be able to enter a selection.
- Machine must prompt the user for payment and amount in US dollars.
- If user enters in payment, calculation must occur and be reported.
- Machine must state the current state of the transaction.
- Actions must be cleanly logged for audit purposes.
  ### Bonus features:
- Unit testing.
- UI/UX for the user entry and product loading.
  ### Rules and guidelines:

1. Source must be loaded into a public GitHub repository.
2. Feel free to use any 3rd party libraries or resources.
3. Utilizing existing tools like Maven and open source libraries is encouraged.
4. While a full solution is best, incomplete submissions still be evaluated on approach.
5. It is required that you provide a README detailing the challenge. Your README should
   include instructions to run your code, and a description of the approach you took to solve
   the challenge.
6. Submission deadline: Solution must be received by Talent Acquisition Team within 1
   week.
